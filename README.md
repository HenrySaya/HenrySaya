# 👋 Hello World! I'm Henry Saya

### 🧠 Software Engineer | 🎓 BSc Computer Science | 🌍 Open Source Contributor | 🔐 Tech for Impact

---

I'm a **software engineer** with a deep curiosity for how technology shapes the world — and how we can shape it back. With a **Bachelor’s in Computer Science** and hands-on training from **ALX Africa**, I build software that solves real problems, inspires action, and brings ideas to life.

### 🔭 What I'm Working On

- 🚚 **Shipment Management System** for an environmental firm — real-time tracking, smart data analytics, and bottle efficiency metrics.  
- 🗺️ **Map Dashboard** – building dynamic components using **Vue 3** + **Vuetify 3**, helping teams visualize environmental data better.
- 🧪 Constantly learning, building, and contributing to open-source projects that align with sustainability, education, and security.
